## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a student at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. My goal is to use what I learn as an engineer to innovate and change people’s lives. I am passionate about designing practical solutions that combine creativity with technical skill, whether it’s developing new technologies, improving existing systems, or contributing to projects that have a meaningful impact on communities and the world around me. 

So far, I have gained hands-on experience through engineering, mentoring, and leadership roles. On Cornell Hyperloop’s Mechanical Team, I design and fabricate subsystems for a magnetic levitation pod, working with SolidWorks, machining, and testing to push the boundaries of high-speed transportation. As a Project Engineer Intern with Conti Civil, I contributed to the Hudson Tunnel Project by inspecting site progress, coordinating suppliers, and supporting daily operations across multiple work zones. Beyond engineering, I mentor younger students in coding through Curious Cardinals, helping them build problem-solving skills and creativity, and I’ve coached youth soccer teams, where I developed strong leadership, communication, and team-building abilities. These experiences have taught me how to combine technical expertise with collaboration and adaptability to achieve meaningful results.
